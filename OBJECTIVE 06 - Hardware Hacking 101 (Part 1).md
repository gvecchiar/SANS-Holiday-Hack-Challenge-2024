>-	Hey, I just caught wind of this neat way to piece back shredded paper! It's a fancy heuristic detection technique—sharp as an elf’s wit, I tell ya! Got a sample Python script right here, courtesy of Arnydo. Check it out when you have a sec: [heuristic_edge_detection.py]((https://gist.github.com/arnydo/5dc85343eca9b8eb98a0f157b9d4d719)).
>-	Have you ever wondered how elves manage to dispose of their sensitive documents? Turns out, they use this fancy shredder that is quite the marvel of engineering. It slices, it dices, it makes the paper practically disintegrate into a thousand tiny pieces. Perhaps, just perhaps, we could reassemble the pieces?

## PROCEDURE : ##
### 🥈 SILVER MEDAL ###

We are given a “Santa’s little Helper (SLH) Access Card Maintenance Tool” UART-Bridge device that needs to be connected correctly to the terminal in order to access it.  We have a manual showing us the pinouts of the SLH but nothing more.

This information is enough to correctly connect the UART to the terminal and open up the console that is provided.  The correct connections are as follows:

- `GND` on the SLH goes to `G` on the terminal (preferably use a Green jumper wire for this)

- `VCC` on the SLH goes to `V` on the terminal (preferably use a Red jumper wire for this)

- `Rx` on the SLH needs to be connected to the transmitting pin `T` on the terminal

- `Tx` on the SLH need to be connected to the receiving pin `R` on the terminal

- The USB Type-C Connector goes on the USB port on the right-hand side of the SLH.
  
If we power on the terminal using the **P** button and try to establish a serial connection by pressing the **S** button, smoke comes out of one of the ICs on the terminal.  So we’ve most probably provided too much voltage.  Luckily there’s no permanent damage and we can just switch the DIP switch on the SLH to **3V**.

Now we no longer get smoke if we try to establish a serial connection but the terminal window tells us that our settings are incorrect.  Looking at the settings, we already know that the port to use is `USB0`.  However we need to determine the settings to use for the `Baud rate`, `Parity`, `Data`, `Stop bits` and `Flow Control` parameters.  

It’s clear now that we should be able to determine these settings from the pile of paper shreds we collected in the previous objective.  If only there was a way to reconstruct the original document!

The hints make this task quite easy for us by pointing us towards a Python script called `heuristic_edge_detection.py`.  Just by running this script and pointing it towards the folder with the paper slices in it, we are given a reconstructed image.  It needs to be flipped horizontally and edited very slightly, but the end result is a very useful document which just so happens to have all the information we’re looking for.

- Port: USB0
- Baud: 115200
- Parity: Even
- Data: 7 Bits
- Stop Bits: 1 bit
- Flow Ctrl: RTS

When we press the **S** button we get a successful serial connection 😊

### 🥇 GOLD MEDAL ###
For the Gold Medal Jewel Loggins tells us that there is a way of completing the challenge bypassing the hardware altogether.

To start tackling this part of the challenge we should have a close look at the source code.  Luckily there are plenty of inline comments to help us understand the code.  There is one part that sticks out thanks to the chunk of comments included with it in *lines 872 to 901*.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80b9a016-1a70-4cb2-a946-ea5c77e7dfac)

This snippet of code gives us a lot of useful information:
  1.	There is an older version of the API (`v1`) that may be vulnerable to hacking.
  2.	JSON data is submitted to server with `/api/v2/complete` appended to the URI address
  3.	The JSON data contains the `requestID`, a value for `serial` and a value for `voltage`

To obtain the URI address and `requestID` we can have a look at the Elements tab of the Developer Tools window.  `requestID` is one of the paramters passed in the URI of the iframe.

From completing the Silver Medal, we also know that the value of voltage should be `3`.

This leaves us with the question of what should be passed as the value of `serial`. If we try running the app through BurpSuite we can see that serial is an array of 6 values – which rings a bell since we had to provide 6 parameters to the PDA to establish the serial connection for the Silver Medal solution.  Searching through the code again, we find an interesting section from *line 208 to 224*, which defines the arrays containing all the options on the PDA:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5840303c-406e-4b08-8b56-538306cf6a07)

This section also defines a variable called `options` which shows us the order in which the options are stored in the array.  From this we can conclude that serial should be an array containing the correct index values for `port`, `baud`, `parity`, `bits`, `stopbits` and `flow ctrl` in that precise order.

The correct index values we need to pass are as follows (remember that array indexes always start from 0!):
-	`port[3] = USB0`
-	`baud[9] = 115200`
-	`parityOptions[2] = even`
-	`dataBits[2] = 7`
-	`stopBits[0] = 1`
-	`flowControlOptions[3]=RTS`
  
So the correct array is `serial= [3,9,2,2,0,3]`

With all this information at hand, we can make a simple curl POST request with our `requestID`, the value of `serial` and `voltage` to the URI for API v1; [https://hhc24-hardwarehacking.holidayhackchallenge.com/api/v1/complete](https://hhc24-hardwarehacking.holidayhackchallenge.com/api/v1/complete)

I used [a simple Python Script](Code/hardware_hacking_bruteforce.py) for this (repurposing part of what I used for brute-forcing the Frosty Keypad). After running the code, I can see that I was awarded the gold medal for the challenge – hooray!
